 Technology Sector

---

## Introduction

**Employee Selection System** is a comprehensive data analysis and machine learning project focused on improving the hiring process in organizations. This project utilizes a dataset containing various attributes of job applicants to predict departmental suitability, offering a data-driven approach to employee selection.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately determine the most suitable department for a job applicant based on their academic and professional background. This system aims to enhance the recruitment process, optimize employee allocation, and aid in personalized training program development.

## Steps Executed

- **Data Preparation:** Loaded and cleaned the dataset, handling missing values and incorrect formats.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzed distributions, relationships between variables, and gathered relevant insights.
- **Feature Engineering:** Transformed and normalized the data, encoding categorical variables and creating new features.
- **Model Development:** Utilized various classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Model Evaluation:** Conducted hyperparameter tuning and assessed models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usefulness

This project is particularly useful for HR departments and recruitment agencies. It automates and streamlines the employee selection process, leading to more accurate and efficient placement decisions. By leveraging data, the system reduces human biases, improves departmental alignment, and enhances overall organizational efficiency.

## Results and Key Insights

- **High Accuracy Models:** Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models demonstrated high accuracy.
- **Important Predictors:** Key features like 'Degree_Field' and '12th_field' were significant in predicting department suitability.
- **Diverse Influence:** Factors such as academic performance, age, and work experience played varied roles in department allocation.
- **Minimal Bias:** Balanced performance across different departments, reducing the risk of biased predictions.
